operator overloading allows you to define custom behaviors for standard operators when used with user-defined types (such as classes or structures). This enables you to make your classes behave like built-in types and provides a more intuitive and natural syntax for operations involving your custom types.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class ComplexNumber {
private:
    double real;
    double imaginary;

public:
    ComplexNumber(double r, double i) : real(r), imaginary(i) {}

    // Overloading the + operator for ComplexNumber
    ComplexNumber operator+(const ComplexNumber &other) const {
        return ComplexNumber(real + other.real, imaginary + other.imaginary);
    }

    // Function to display the complex number
    void display() {
        std::cout << real << " + " << imaginary << "i" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    ComplexNumber c1(2.0, 3.0);
    ComplexNumber c2(1.5, 2.5);

    ComplexNumber result = c1 + c2; // Using the overloaded + operator

    c1.display();
    c2.display();
    result.display();

    return 0;
}

```

In this example:

1. We define a `ComplexNumber` class representing complex numbers, with real and imaginary parts.
2. We overload the `+` operator using a member function called `operator+`. This function takes another `ComplexNumber` as a parameter and returns a new `ComplexNumber` object representing the sum of the two complex numbers.
3. In the `main` function, we create two `ComplexNumber` objects `c1` and `c2`.
4. We use the overloaded `+` operator to add `c1` and `c2`, which creates a new `ComplexNumber` object containing the sum.
5. We call the `display` function to print the original complex numbers and the result.

Operator overloading allows you to provide intuitive and meaningful behaviors for operators when working with your custom classes. In this example, we've overloaded the `+` operator to add two complex numbers together, creating a more natural and readable way to perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers.
